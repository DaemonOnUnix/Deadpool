Initially the fourth challenge of CHES2015 CTF was an image ```rom.png```.
As this is not the purpose of this repository, we'll skip the image extraction and provide directly the ROM file ```rom.bin```.
If you're curious about the initial step of the challenge, see [this write-up](https://wiki.yobi.be/index.php/CHES2015_Writeup#First_step_4).

```rom.bin``` is a Gameboy ROM which can be used in various emulators.
